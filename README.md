# Pointer Arithmentic and Iterators

## Intro

This project demonstrates elementary pointer arithmetic in C/C++ and shows its relationship
to Standard Template Library iterators.

I blame it on the fact that I program in multiple languages, but it seems that every time 
I want to initialize a vector or list, I have to hit Google.  My hope is that this project 
will cement that knowledge for me once and for all, but if not, at least I'll have a handy
cheat sheet.

## Building

I developed this project on 64-bit Linux Mint 17.2.

The compiler was g++ (Ubuntu 4.9.3-8ubuntu2~14.04) 4.9.3.

After cloning the project, you can build and run it using *make*:

```
make clean run 
```

The executable created by this project is called *main*.
